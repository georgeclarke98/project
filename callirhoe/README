Third year project, an engaging history tool, a command line calendar creator for historical corpus' and events.

Requirements:

Non python installations (using brew on MacOS):
    brew install imagemagick
    brew install ghostscript
    
To install callirhoe and calmagick:
    in callirhoe folder run:
      make all
      (if callirhoe and calmagick exist run rm callirhoe calmagick)
      
The parser (parser.py) collects the data from the self made corpus or turns the users excel spreadsheet into a csv file. This runs in python 3 to set up in a python 3 environment (recommended anaconda):
    pip install -r requirementsParser.txt 
    python parser.py 
    
To set up in an environment where python 2 is present:
    pip3 install -r requrementsParser.txt
    python3 parser.py

The creator.py and creatorGUI.py both run in python 2 (sadly) as callirhoe and calmagick were made for python 2. To set these up in a python 2 environment:
    pip install -r requirementsCreator.txt
    python creator.py
    python creatorGUI.py
    
The creatorGUI.py uses a nice interface to create the calendars and the creator.py uses the command line

A fully packaged version of all of these programs are on the way! 
So a simple .exe file will soon replace using the command line.
