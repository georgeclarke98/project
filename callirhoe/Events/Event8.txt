Alexandra Park is opened

06/08/1870

Alexandra Park is a 60-acre (24 ha) park in the Whalley Range district of Manchester, England. It was designed by Alexander Gordon Hennell and opened to the public in 1870 with the initial purpose to "deter the working men of Manchester from the alehouses during their day off". The lodge and gateways are the work of Alfred Darbyshire. The park was developed by the Manchester Corporation before the area was incorporated into the city, being sited wholly in the then Withington Local Board area; the site was purchased in 1864 by Manchester Corporation from William Egerton, 1st Baron Egerton. The roads to the East and West sides of the park were named Princess Road and Alexandra Road also in honour of Princess Alexandra.
