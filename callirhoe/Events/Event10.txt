Founding of Joseph Jordan's School of Anatomy

01/10/1814

Formal medical education in Manchester began in 1814 when Joseph Jordan opened the first anatomy school in the English provinces. Previous lecture courses in medicine had included a series given by Peter Mark Roget, then a physician at Manchester Infirmary (1804â€“8), but better known for his later Thesaurus. Jordan, however, offered dissections as well as lectures, and medical education proved good business. In London the private anatomy schools, which had competed with each other for decades, became incorporated with the hospitals, but in the provinces private medical schools continued beyond 1870, using the hospitals for clinical teaching but not formally attached to them.
