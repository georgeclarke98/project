 The Hallé gives its first concert as a permanent orchestra,30/01/1858,"In May 1857 the pianist and conductor Charles Hallé set up an orchestra to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition,  which it did until October.  Hallé decided to continue working with the  orchestra as a formal organisation, and it gave its first concert under  those auspices on 30 January 1858.  The orchestra's first home was the Free Trade Hall. By 1861 the orchestra was in financial trouble, and it performed only two concerts that year.Hans Richter served as music director from 1899 to 1911. During his tenure, the orchestra gave the first performance of the Symphony No. 1 of Sir Edward Elgar. In 1943 the orchestra was again in crisis, having diminished in size to 30 players. Over the next 27 years, from 1943 to 1970, the orchestra's next music director, Sir John Barbirolli, restored the Hallé to national prominence.  Together, they made many recordings, including the first recording of Ralph Vaughan Williams' Symphony No. 8,  of which they also gave the first performance.  During Barbirolli's  tenure, one of the most notable orchestra members was concertmaster  Martin Milner, who served in that capacity from 1958 to 1987.   Barbirolli regarded Milner as his ""right-hand man"" and once wrote in  appreciation to him: ""You are the finest leader I have ever had in my  fairly long career.""  Kent Nagano  was principal conductor of the orchestra from 1992 to 1999.  The  orchestra moved from the Free Trade Hall to the Bridgewater Hall in 1996  as its primary concert venue.

It is not intended to teach the trade of the Machine-maker, the Dyer, the Carpenter, the Mason, or any other particular business, but there is no art which does not depend, more or less, on scientific principles, and to teach what these are, and to point out their practical application, will form the chief object of this Institution.
The most notable of the founders were William Fairbairn, Richard Roberts, George William Wood, George Philips, Joseph Brotherton and Benjamin Heywood.
