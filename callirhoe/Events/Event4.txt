The American Civil War breaks out, leading to the Lancashire Cotton Famine

12/04/1861

The Lancashire Cotton Famine, also known as the Cotton Famine or the Cotton Panic (1861â€“65), was a depression in the textile industry of North West England, brought about by overproduction in a time of contracting world markets. It coincided with the interruption of baled cotton imports caused by the American Civil War, and speculators buying up new stock, for storage in the shipping warehouses at the ports of entry.
