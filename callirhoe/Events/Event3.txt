Medical and surgical degrees were now allowed to be awarded for the first time

20/03/1883

A faculty of medicine opened in 1873 (at Owens College), and medical degrees were awarded by the Victoria University from 1883. The school was made co-educational in 1899 after a long and contentious debate about whether women could be members of the College at all.
