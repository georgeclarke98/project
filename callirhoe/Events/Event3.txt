Owens College, predecessor of the University of Manchester, is established under the bequest of John Owens (merchant), originally at Cobden House, Quay Street

12/03/1851

Owens College was founded in 1851, named after John Owens, a textile merchant, who left a bequest of Â£96,942 for the purpose. Its first accommodation was at Cobden House on Quay Street, Manchester, in a house which had been the residence of Richard Cobden. In 1859, Owens College was approved as a provincial examination centre for matriculation candidates of the University of London. As the college progressed it became inadequate so a move to Chorlton on Medlock was planned in 1871.
