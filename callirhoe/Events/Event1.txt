Astromoners Andrew Lyne, Michael Kramer, and collaborators at Jodrell Bank discovered the double pulsar 

08/01/2004

In 2003, Lyne and his team discovered the first binary system found in which both components were pulsed neutron stars. Lyne's colleague Richard Manchester called the PSR J0737-3039 system a "fantastic natural laboratory" for studying specialized effects of the General Theory of Relativity. Other recent work that Lyne has undertaken includes research on the globular cluster at 47 Tucanae, whose dense stellar population acts as a nursery for millisecond and binary pulsars
