Telephony in Greater Manchester: first such telephone in regular use in the country

26/01/1878

Telephony in Greater Manchester - Telegraph manufacturer Charles Moseley installs a telephone between a hardware merchant (Thomas Hudson Ltd) on Shudehill to company offices on Dantzic Street, the first such telephone in regular use in the country. In November 1877, while telephony was in its infancy, just 18 months after Alexander Graham Bell had made the world's first phone call, Charles Moseley, the son of a Manchester rubber manufacturer (then making telegraph equipment), took an interest in Bell's work. Bell himself had first demonstrated the telephone to Queen Victoria who placed the UK's first long distance call from Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, on 14 January 1878.
