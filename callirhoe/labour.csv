The Homestead Strike,06/07/1892,,"<p>This occasional series will highlight moments in American labor and working-class history writ large, including the history of American radicalism and the history of slavery, which too often takes a backseat in American labor history. You can expect 1-3 of these posts a month.

The Bisbee Deportation,12/07/1917,,"<p>The summer of 1917 was tense in the United States. The entrance of the nation into World War I that spring seemed to place the entire nation on edge. Progressivism, a diverse movement with widely mixed motivations among its members, showed its dark side like never before, using the increasingly activist federal government to suppress all perceived threats to middle-class, patriotic America. The Wilson Administration cracked down on dissent, passing the Espionage Act in June, a law used, along with several other laws passed during the war, to crack down on any criticism of the war. Anti-immigrant movements increased their activities–after nearly 40 years of intense immigration, Americans’ feared more than ever immigrants’ impact upon the nation. The prohibition movement also took advantage of the war, using the connection between immigrants and alcohol to push through the 18th Amendment. Vigilante attacks against labor organizers, particularly radical labor, increased. To name one notorious incident, I.W.W. organizer Frank Little was lynched in the summer of 1917 in Butte, Montana and probably by Pinkertons (a future topic in this series).</p><p><a href=""http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/07/this-date-in-labor-history-july-12-1917"">Read whole article</a></p>",http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bisbee_deportation_guns.jpg,"Bisbee, Arizona","31.4481547,-109.9284084",,,

Local leaders, determined to stop the I.W.W. from entering their nice little town and influencing their striking shingle weavers, opened fire on the docking boat, killing at least 5 I.W.W. members, though probably closer to 12. 2 deputies died as well, shot in the back by friendly fire.

The Centralia Massacre,11/11/1919,,"<p>On November 11, 1919, the people of Centralia, Washington, a small lumber town in the southwestern part of the state, celebrated the first anniversary of Armistice Day with a parade. However, town leaders and the local American Legion post decided to turn the parade into an attack upon Centralia’s Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.) union hall, which they considered the center of subversion and sedition in their community. When the Legion reached the hall, they broke in and began tearing the place apart. What they did not expect was that the radical loggers had prepared an ambush. The I.W.W. had stationed at least two shooters on a hill approximately ¼ mile away. In addition, some of the workers in the hall had weapons. In the hail of bullets, four American Legion members died. Warren Grimm, a University of Washington graduate and lawyer, had not only fought in World War I, but had also served in the military’s anti-Bolshevik force in Siberia before returning to his home town of Centralia. Arthur McElfresh had spent eighteen months in the army in France. The third dead Legionnaire was Ben Casagranda, a Greek-American who went to war for his new nation. The fourth was another University of Washington graduate and member of the Centralia elite, Dale Hubbard.</p><p><a href=""http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/11/this-day-in-labor-history-november-11-1919"">Read whole article</a></p>",http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/goryhistory.jpg,"Centralia, Washington","46.7204489,-122.9614303",,,

Minneapolis Teamsters Strike,16/05/1934,,"<p>In the early 1930s, the Teamsters were already a conservative and often corrupt union, particularly in the upper eschelons of leadership. But the locals were a different story. Because they organized truck drivers, the workplace of teamsters was the road. They saw a lot of worksites and talked to a lot of different people. They developed a strong sense of solidarity with other workers and their struggles. On the local level, this atmosphere could help generate radicalism. Such was the case in Minneapolis where members of the Communist League of America took control of Local 574. By working in the coldest, harshest conditions, they organized the coal drivers in the winter of 1934, forcing employers to cave so that coal could be delivered. This success led truckers to join Local 574 in droves. </p><p><a href=""http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/05/this-day-in-labor-history-may-16-1934"">Read whole article</a></p>",http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ibt.jpg,"Minneapolis, MN","44.9706705,-93.26821774",,,

While unsuccessful (and insane if one assumes he wanted something other than martyrdom), Brown’s raid did more than almost anything else in the 1850s to highlight the differences between northern and southern labor systems and the moral bankruptcy of the latter. Agree or disagree with his actions, he made it almost impossible for northern whites to claimed to be abolitionists to hide behind gradual programs or a vague hope for the future. For southern whites, it was a call to arms against increasingly radical anti-slavery forces in the north and the desires of slaves to escape. For African-Americans, at least the few who had the opportunity to take advantage of Brown’s actions, it was the deliverance from a hell of forced labor and degradation for which they had prayed. </p><p><a href=""http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/10/this-day-in-labor-history-october-16-1859"">Read whole article</a></p>",http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/brown_john2.jpg,"Harpers Ferry, WV","39.323418,-77.7319766",,,

Farwell sued the company for damages. The 1842 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Court set into place the doctrine of worker risk. This decision set a vitally important precedent in American labor history that the worker voluntarily took on risk when he or she agreed to be employed on the job.

Cherry Mine Fire in Illinois kills 259 workers.,13/11/1909,,"<p>On November 13, 1909, at the Cherry Mine in Cherry, Illinois, a coal car filled with hay for the mules who worked underground rolled down a track. Earlier that week, an electrical outage had struck the mine. The miners were then forced to use torches, kerosene lamps, and other flammable forms of lighting while at work. Hay sticking out from the edge of the car brushed up against a torch and caught fire. The car moved down the track, spreading the fire. As the mine caught fire, the company closed the oxygen supply to the mine. This tampered down the fire but also began suffocating the workers. 259 miners died, the worst coal mine fire in U.S. history. </p><p><a href=""http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/11/this-day-in-labor-history-november-13-1909"">Read whole article</a></p>",,"Cherry, Illinois","41.4269787,-89.213419",,,

"Theodore Roosevelt and Japanese government agree to Gentlemen’s Agreement, ends most Japanese immigration to the U.S. after west coast labor protests",15/02/1907,,"<p>West Coast employers wanted cheap labor. The region received very little immigration from southern and eastern Europe like the east, so they had to be creative. Originally, western employers hired the Chinese to do menial work, but the angry response from west coast labor that led to the Chinese Exclusion Act, the first major legislative victory for organized labor in the nation’s history, ended that supply in 1882. So employers turned to Japan. Japan in the 1880s was modernizing rapidly, but was still poor. Encouraging migration was a useful way to undermine internal social problems. Almost immediately after 1882, Japanese migration to the United States soared. Much of this was to the sugar plantations of the American soon-to-be colony in Hawaii, but large numbers came to California, Oregon, and Washington as well. There they would serve as a key part of the low-wage labor force for the next sixty years. </p><p><a href=""http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2014/02/this-day-in-labor-history-february-15-1907"">Read whole article</a></p>",http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/japanese_americans_1.jpg,,#N/A,,,

More importantly to Nixon, he saw it as a way to undercut organized labor, creating a coalition of African-Americans and Republicans against racist unions. Opponents of the new principle of affirmative action immediately sued to kill the new policy, but the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in its favor in 1971 and the Supreme Court rejected the appeal.

Sure, slavery might be effectively dead as of April 14, 1865, when Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, but was the U.S. military there to enforce freedom on the plantations? Largely, no. The immediate months after the war were filled with violence as whites killed newly freed people in the countryside, especially as they began to flee for cities like Memphis and New Orleans. For cotton planters, this black flight was a real threat. They prospered on owning black labor. If they couldn’t own that labor, planters at least needed to keep it on the land to pick the cotton that might allow them to rebuild their economic base. </p><p><a href=""http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2014/11/day-labor-history-november-25-1865"">Read whole article</a></p>",,,#N/A,,,

Unfortunately, the United States Senate never ratified it, showing the difficulty international standards, labor and otherwise, have always had in becoming law in the United States and the damage that can do for the effectiveness of these agreements.

Steelworkers Strike of 1959 begins,15/07/1959,,"<p>On July 15, 1959, the United Steelworkers of America went on strike to protect its significant victories won after World War II in running the shop floor and empowering its members to live a middle-class lifestyle. Perhaps the most underrated event in American labor history, the steel strike of 1959 touches on many of the key labor issues of the postwar period. Combining the total number workers and length of the strike, companies lost more employee hours than any other strike in American history. It showed the height of worker power in American labor history on the shop floor and through the contract. It also demonstrated how government would still bust strikes when it could, a blast from the past and a foretaste of the future. Yet it also suggested just how far unions had come in American society, given how the USWA overcame these challenges and won. Finally, this was the end of the peak of American labor militancy.</p><p><a href=""http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2015/07/this-day-in-labor-history-july-15-1959"">Read whole article</a></p>",,,#N/A,,,

This astounding decision helped doom the already floundering McGovern campaign, helping to guarantee another victory for Richard Nixon. It also placed a permanent divide between non-labor progressives in the Democratic Party and the labor movement, one that still has not been fully bridged today.

This event was a key moment in the American working class standing up to the environmental depredations of American industry and eventually led to the creation of Superfund, the last major environmental legislation passed to address the popularly-based environmentalism of protecting people from pollution that played a major role in American politics during the 1970s.</p><p><a href=""http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2015/08/this-day-in-labor-history-august-7-1978"">Read whole article</a></p>",,,#N/A,,,

The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom,28/08/1963,,"<p>On August 28, 1963, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom took place in Washington, DC. This famous event is of course most often remembered for Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, or more specifically the 3 lines of it that conservatives have decided justify their own positions. But even among liberals and civil rights activists what is often forgotten or downplayed in the memory of this event is the central role economic issues played in it. Most of the economic agenda of the 1960s civil rights movement in fact is barely remembered. That’s a huge problem because not only were African-Americans fighting for the opportunity for economic advancement as well as to end segregation and for the vote but also because it presents an incomplete history which takes away part of the reason this movement so challenged American life. </p><p><a href=""http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2015/08/this-day-in-labor-history-august-28-1963"">Read whole article</a></p>",,,#N/A,,,
