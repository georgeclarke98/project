The goal of this project is to produce a user friendly set of tools for producing engaging online history.
Try to produce a set of sites and apps working from the  “This Day In Labor History” corpus which:

1) presents the corpus in electronic calendar form
2) allows for the production of custom paper calendars derived from the corpus
(e.g., as offered by https://www.myphotobook.co.uk/photo-calendar or https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/create.html )
3) presents the corpus in TimeMap form (fixing various usability issues)
 
all while allowing fairly non technical people to contribute new articles and perspectives.
 
Update project steps:

1.cd /Users/jay/Desktop/callirhoe-master 
2.git status
3.git commit -a -m "tag"
4.git push

Users are allowed to generate their own calenders that the project provided ( in different themes)
  
The demo calendars
 
$ python FirstDemo.py

$ python Actdemo.py
  
Labour history in 1900s
  
$ python 1900_demo.py
  
Labour history in 1800s
