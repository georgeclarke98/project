Loco Foco rally leads to Flour Riot

13/02/1837

On February 13, 1837, the Equal Rights Party, better known as the Loco Focos although that was a pejorative from the cityâ€™s Whigs, held a rally in City Hall Park in New York City to protest the high cost of living. This led to the Flour Riot, where workers raided flour mills to gain what they thought what rightfully belonged to them at a much lower price than they paid. This brief moment of labor agitation is a good window into both the problems early 19th century urban workers faced, as well as their nascent labor organizations.
